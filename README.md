# CoFI Resources

A collection of markdown files that may one day become a CoFI book. At this moment in time 
it is a collection of information that is of relevance across InLab's open source software 
ecosytem.


The book is using [jupyter books](www.jupyterbook.org) and can be built locally after cloning the repository using
```
jupyter-book build cofi_book/
```

It also gets deployed via github actions and is available at [https://inlab.au/cofi-resources/docs/index.html] (https://inlab.au/cofi-resources/docs/index.html)
